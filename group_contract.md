## Communication: <br/> 										
Logistical discussions and minor issues will be communicated through WhatsApp conversations. The WhatsApp group was created by agreement among the group members at the first meeting, held on January 28th at 9 am. All members are required to respond to group messages in less than 24 hours. However, it is expected that messages will be replied to much sooner and that active discussion will happen through the platform.<br/> 							
Technical or code-specific communication will be focused on the GitHub platform. All members are expected to use the issues function and send clear commit messages. 

## Meetings: 	<br/>										 
The first meeting was held on January 28th at 9am. Subsequent meetings will be scheduled through the WhatsApp group. The meeting location will be on Zoom unless otherwise agreed upon by all group members. Meeting dates and times will be decided by sending a when2meet poll in the WhatsApp group. It is expected that the group will meet at least once before every project deadline and more times if necessary. <br/>
It is also expected that all group members will be fully present in meetings and contribute to the conversation. More than one absence on meetings where the member had previously indicated availability and without a valid excuse will be noted by the other members in their evaluation.	<br/>										
Each member should come to the meeting with a list of topics they would like to be addressed. Meetings will use the following structure. First, each member will give a summary of their work since the last meeting in a stand-up style. Second, all members will have the opportunity to present any issues that they might be facing and the group will work collaboratively to solve them. Third, any general issues surrounding the project and the next deadlines will be discussed. Fifth, logistical issues such as the next assignments or re-assigning tasks will be discussed. 			<br/>	
Meeting minutes will be taken at all meetings and members carry this responsibility on a rolling basis (in alphabetical order of the first name). 

## Distribution of work fairly and equitably: 						
After scheduling a meeting through WhatsApp, the group will meet and divide the work among the group members. All assignments must be made in consensus amount all group members. Should a group member realize later that their assigned task requires more or less time commitment than the others, they shall inform the other group members on WhatsApp and another meeting will be scheduled. 

## Expected work hours: <br/>										       
The expectation is that each member will work 5 – 6 hours per week on their respective project tasks. If a team member encounters barriers and is not able to complete their work, then the member should give advanced notice on the WhatsApp group so that the assignment can be redistributed or a meeting scheduled.

## Work style: 	<br/>										
Each member will work on their assigned work individually, if any code issues arise then they should refer to the GitHub platform and communicate that with the team members. After each work session, members are expected to commit their work to Github and send a clear commit message detailing all changes made and issues yet to be resolved. Each member is expected to finalize their assigned work before the following meeting unless otherwise agreed upon. 
												
## Quality of work: 	<br/>									    
Each member will be assigned a code-writing tasks and a proof-reading task. They are expected to complete both before the next meeting. Each member is expected to do the best work they can and put in significant effort. If a member is not able to submit work that shows quality and throughness they should indicate so in advance of the next deadline so that the work can be re-assigned or overlooked by another member. 			<br/>							 
All members are expected to thoroughly inspect any draft of the final submission of any assignment and make any relevant suggestions for changes that would improve the work. 	<br/>	 
The group also commits to an environment of collaboration and mutual respect. Each member is expected to respond to other members’ suggestions and provide suggestions for others’ work as well. All suggestions shall be respectful and mindful of the challenges others might be facing.

## Breach of Contract: <br/>
Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:			<br/> 
1. The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions. 	<br/>
2. The second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and write an agreement to follow the team contract is required by the member.		<br/>						 
3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs about the issues with the teammate. 	 <br/>
4. With very serious or continuous breaches the team will reach out to the professor. <br/>
Note: This three-step warning system is a guideline and not a fixed rule. If the other team members agree that the breach was serious enough to warrant the dismissal of the system, the group is allowed to jump directly into steps 2, 3 or 4.

# Contributor Code of Conduct 

## Pledge
We pledge to create and foster a collaborative and inclusive community. We believe that
collaboration and creativity go hand-in-hand, leading to exceptional results. We reinforce
the need for respect and tolerance among collaborators, recognizing each person's challenges
and showing empathy towards others.


## Statement on Equity, Diversity and Inclusivity 
Diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences create a more welcoming and productive environment.
Consequently, equity, diversity, and inclusion are core to the successful completion of the project and to a happier team. 
<br/>
Equity means that people of all identities are treated fairly. Their rights, 
responsibilities and opportunities are not dependent upon identity.<br/>
Diversity consists of the conditions, expressions, and experiences of different 
individuals. It encompasses the unique qualities and characteristics that we all possess.<br/>
Inclusion is the cultivation of an environment in which all people are respected, where 
their differences are embraced, and where they all have access to the same opportunities.


## Expected Behaviour 
- Use welcoming, inclusive, and language.
- Speak in a professional and non-aggressive tone. 
- Recognize and respect cultural and linguistic differences in writing and speaking.
- Perform work to the best of your abilities.
- Recognize the effort of others. 
- Provide criticism in the form of constructive feedback.
- Accept criticism and always try to improve your work. 
- Focus on the development of the project and community.
- Be supportive of collaborators.


## Unacceptable Behaviour
- Sexual advances and behaviour of any kind, including sexualized language, imagery, and comments.
- Harassment of any kind, including trolling, insulting or derogatory comments and attacks on others
- Any form of intolerance or prejudice. 
- Microaggressions, intimidation, and tone policing. 
- Sharing private information of collaborators without their explicit consent. 
- Any illegal activity as per Canadian Law. 
- Any other activity which no reasonable person would consider ethical or appropriate for a professional setting. 


## Consequences for Unacceptable Behaviour 
- Instances of unacceptable behaviour of any kind should be reported to one of the other collaborators.
- Any unacceptable behaviour will be considered a breach of the team contract and will follow the procedure outlined in the section Breach of Contract. <br/>
- All collaborators are required to act and follow the outlined procedures if any unacceptable behaviour is witnessed or reported.

## Breach of Contract: 
Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:<br/>			 
1. The first step is a written WhatsApp notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract and code of conduct conditions. <br/>	
2. The second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and the violating member will be required to write an agreement to follow the team contract and code of conduct.<br/>
3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs about the issues with the teammate. 	 <br/>
4. With very serious or continuous breaches the team will reach out to the professor. <br/>
Note: This three-step warning system is a guideline and not a fixed rule. If the other team members agree that the breach was serious enough to warrant the 
dismissal of the system, the group is allowed to jump directly into steps 2, 3 or 4.
